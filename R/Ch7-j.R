# constants (mean, std)

# Compute KNN
#
# use knn() to compute knn. 
# knn() is available in library FNN (provides a list of the nearest neighbors)
# and library class (allows a numerical output variable).
nn <- knn(train = train.norm.df[, 1:2], test = new.norm.df, 
          cl = train.norm.df[, 3], k = 3)
# look at the returned object
nn
# use the returned object to pick the row numbers for the neighbors
row.names(train.df)[attr(nn, "nn.index")]
# look at the neighbors' targets
train.df[row.names(train.df)[attr(nn, "nn.index")],]
# Majority voting would yield "owner" for the test (as shown in the nn object)



#
# Choosing k - Use the Hold-out Method and evaluate the accuracy of the classifier
# with different values of k
#
# First show how the knn() function will predict for multiple test values
knn.pred <- knn(train.norm.df[, 1:2], valid.norm.df[, 1:2], 
                cl = train.norm.df[, 3], k = 2)
# show the results
knn.pred
# compare to the actual values
valid.norm.df[, 3]
# Finally, the confusion matrix
(cm <- confusionMatrix(knn.pred, valid.norm.df[, 3]))
# look at the cm object in the object view)
# the accuract
cm$overall[1]
# in one step
confusionMatrix(knn.pred, valid.norm.df[, 3])$overall[1]

# Now iterate through k = 1, 2, 3, ..., 14 and store the accuracy for each
# initialize a data frame with two columns: k, and accuracy.
accuracy.df <- data.frame(k = seq(1, 14, 1), accuracy = rep(0, 14))

# compute knn for different k on validation.

  accuracy.df[i, 2] <- confusionMatrix(knn.pred, valid.norm.df[, 3])$overall[1] 
}
accuracy.df
# 8 appears to be the best value for k  


#
## Now that we have the "best" k, use the full dataset as training
# to make our prediction

# Should we re-normalize the full data set?  The current version
# was normalized using the x-bar and s value only from the training
# dataset, but here we're combining the training and validation
# datasets for the prediction.
